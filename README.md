# EPITECH PROJECT - MY_RPG

<br> <br/>

This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own RPG.

Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your team know.

To give the users the feeling that youâ€™re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible your game.

Your game must follow the following rules:
* Having a pleasant user interface.
* Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, ...)
* Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
* Create a game with a beginning and an end.

See the subject for further details !
